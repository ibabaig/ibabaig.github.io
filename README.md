# Portfolio Website

A modern portfolio website built with React. Featuring smooth animations and a colorful editorial aesthetic.

## Color Scheme
My current palette was inspired by colors of water lilies.
- **Light Gray**: #D7DEDF
- **Slate**: #4F6064
- **Deep Plum**: #701648
- **Dark Magenta**: #5A123A
- **Soft Periwinkle**: #B9C5F3

## Features
- Custom color scheme with refined aesthetic
- Smooth scroll animations and transitions
- Fully responsive design
- Single-page application for simplicity
- Built with React/JS and Vite

## Setup

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm
- Git

 **Rebuild web command **
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

### Design Choices

- `#D7DEDF` - Light gray backgrounds
- `#4F6064` - Slate for text and accents
- `#701648` - Deep plum for primary actions
- `#5A123A` - Dark magenta for headings
- `#B9C5F3` - Soft periwinkle for highlights

#### Sparkle Cursor Feature 
- I really wanted to make this more colorful and interactive. Decided to implement cursor trail feature inspired by SarahWFox on CodePen. Made it less stimulating with no static animation and fewer particles, adhering to my color palette.

### To Add New Sections

1. Create a new section component in `src/portfolio.jsx`
2. Add navigation link in the nav menu
3. Update the scroll handler to include the new section

## Technologies Used

- **React 18** - UI library
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **Lucide React** - Icon library
- **CSS-in-JS** - Inline styles with React
- **Google Fonts** - Fraunces & Inter typography
- **Git** - Github pages to deploy website

## Performance
- Animations use CSS transforms for better performance
- Single-page design minimizes loading times
